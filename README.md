**How to use the script?

Its pretty simple

Go to "https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/"

Open the developer tool, this is basically the f12 key combination, if not try to google it

Click on the console tab

Paste the script into the console tab

If no error appears its running, you can also see it in the title of the tab.

There should be an error that says "allow pasting" to continue, just type that into the console and paste the script.

Now everything is set up and working.

Have fun creating endless items!

**You can also go afk**.
