**How do I use the script?**

Its pretty simple

Go to "https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/"

Open the developer tool, this is basically the f12 key combination, if not try googling it

Click on the console tab

Paste the script into the console tab

There should be an error that says "allow pasting" to continue, just type that into the console and paste the script.

If no error appears its running, you can also see it in the title of the tab.

Now everything is set up and working.

Have fun creating endless items!

**You can also go afk**.
